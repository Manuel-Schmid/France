## Info

The website is an ePortfolio about my vacations in the South of France from the fall of 2021. 
As a topic for the ePortfolio I have chosen my vacations in the South of France from the fall of 2021. My family and I went to the   CÃ´te Bleue for two weeks. I set a goal to take photos with my smartphone and record video clips with my GoPro camera during this family vacation. I chose this theme because I consider the sea and nature in the south of France more aesthetic than the environment in Switzerland. It also allowed me to take full advantage of the GoPro's ability to film underwater. During these two weeks I did numerous different activities such as swimming, hiking, visiting cities, motocross riding, boating and scuba diving. My goal was to capture all these activities on video and in my pictures.
